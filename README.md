<b>Technical features</b>
- The whole project was developed using Swift 5.2
- For dependencies, I used Cocoapods.
- Dependencies such as Firebase, Alamofire, RxSwift, RxCocoa, SwiftGen and Swinject were used to develop the project.
- Architecture MVVM with Clean Architecture Principles.
- The project is divided in four main layers 
   - Presentation: All related to UI
   - Domain: All related to data handling
   - Data: All related to get data from server or database
   - DI: All related to dependency injection
 
 - The project is planned to be completely tested by unit tests. That's the reason why I used protocols for all the structures in the project. Due to the time given to develop the project, I was not able to start testing.
